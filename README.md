# MetaChess 🌟

MetaChess is an engaging internet chess platform that emphasizes players' metacognition during gameplay, promoting awareness and pattern recognition. The platform offers an exciting experience with three distinct game types, multiplayer capabilities through Socket.IO, and player statistics stored in a MongoDB database.

📖 **Description**

MetaChess is a chess game built with a modern technology stack, including JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express.js, React, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and Socket.IO. The platform aims to bring chess enthusiasts together to play strategic and thoughtful games while prioritizing metacognitive skills that lead to better gameplay decisions.

🕹️ **Rules**

Protect your KING at all costs! The game conceals Checks and Checkmates, so ignorance can lead to losing the game or missing out on definite wins. Sharpen your strategic thinking, stay aware of the game state, and make preemptive moves. Victory is only declared when one King remains on the board.

🔥 **Key Features**
- **Three Game Types**: Enjoy different game modes for varied experiences:
  - Local: Play with a friend on the same screen, taking turns.
  - Online: Challenge a random player online to a thrilling game.
  - Computer: Test your skills against an AI bot with an approximate 1000 ELO rating.
- **Multiplayer**: Experience real-time multiplayer chess using Socket.IO, allowing you to play with friends or opponents worldwide.
- **Leaderboard**: Track your progress with a leaderboard that displays player stats, including online wins, losses, and victories against the computer.
- **ELO Ranking**: Your ELO rating increases faster with quicker wins, rewarding strategic and efficient gameplay.
